# Cost Optimization Tips

## RapidAPI Ultra Plan ($10/mo, 100k requests)

### How to maximize value with Hybrid Strategy

Your API automatically tries free methods first, then falls back to RapidAPI.

### Monitor Usage

Add logging to track which method is used:

```javascript
// In your API response, check the "source" field:
{
  "text": "...",
  "source": "youtube-transcript"  // Free! ðŸŽ‰
}

{
  "text": "...",
  "source": "rapidapi"  // Paid, but reliable
}
```

### Estimated Monthly Costs

| Usage Pattern | Free Success Rate | RapidAPI Calls | Cost |
|---------------|-------------------|----------------|------|
| Light (50 videos) | 70% | 15 | $10 |
| Medium (500 videos) | 60% | 200 | $10 |
| Heavy (3000 videos) | 50% | 1500 | $10 |
| Very Heavy (10k videos) | 40% | 6000 | $10 |

**You're covered up to ~10,000 videos per month!**

### Tips to Stay Within Limits

1. **Batch processing:** Process videos in batches during off-peak hours
2. **Caching:** If you request the same video twice, cache the result
3. **Error handling:** Don't retry failed videos immediately
4. **Rate limiting:** Respect the 120 req/min limit

### ROI Calculation

**Time saved vs. Manual transcription:**
- Manual: ~10 min per video
- API: ~2 seconds per video
- 100 videos = 16.5 hours saved

**Value:** $10 for 100k requests = You'd need to process only 60 videos per month to break even if your time is worth $10/hour.

### When to Upgrade Further

If you consistently hit 100k requests/month:
- Mega plan: $50/mo for 500k requests
- Or negotiate custom enterprise plan

### Current Setup

Your API is already configured with:
- âœ… Primary: youtube-transcript (free)
- âœ… Fallback: RapidAPI (paid, reliable)
- âœ… Environment variables set on Vercel
- âœ… Automatic failover

**Just activate your RapidAPI subscription and it works!**
